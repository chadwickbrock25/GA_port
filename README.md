Software Development portfolio after General Assembly bootcamp

The technology used is HTML, CSS, Photoshop, & AWS. The links lead to social media, projects, & contact email. Skills gained through the course are listed like boy scout merit badges. The top & bottom background/logo are inspired by the childhood anime that sparked my interest into the software development world. My plans are to continue to add animations/transitions to the projects buttons to further describe the apps as well as more style.
